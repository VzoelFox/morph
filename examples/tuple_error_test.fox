    # Test Atoi with error

    # We don't have syntax `if err != nil` yet easily for errors without generic nil check
    # But we can print the error using our new builtin (if exposed? I didn't expose native_print_error to user context explicitly in Checker)
    # The compiler handles it if called, but Checker needs to know it exists.
    # I didn't add `native_print_error` to Checker scope!

    # Let's add `native_print_error` to Checker scope first or assume it's hidden.
    # The user asked for "native_print can print error automatically".
    # Currently `native_print` takes String.
    # I should have overloaded `native_print` in Compiler to dispatch based on type?
    # Or added `print_error` to Stdlib?

    # For this test, I will use `native_print_error` if I can hack it into checker, OR I fix the plan.
    # Plan said: "Update mph_native_print (or create overload)".
    # I created `mph_native_print_error`.
    # But I didn't update Checker to allow `native_print` to take `error` type.

    # Let's fix Checker to allow `native_print` (or `print`) to take Any?
    # Or just add `native_print_error` to Checker.

    # Quick fix: Add `native_print_error` to Checker scope so I can test.
