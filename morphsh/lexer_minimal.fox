# Minimal Lexer Optimizer - Phase 1
# Status: BLOCKED - String indexing type mismatch
#
# Finding: input[pos] returns int (char code), not string
# Need: String character access helper OR byte-level operations
#
# This demonstrates why incremental testing is critical:
# - 53 lines compiled successfully (parser/type checker)
# - Type errors found immediately (string[int] -> int vs string)
# - Blocker identified before wasting time on large refactor
#
# Next Steps:
# 1. Implement string indexing helper in stdlib OR
# 2. Use byte-level operations with character codes OR
# 3. Wait for string manipulation improvements
#
# Lesson: Start small, fail fast, learn quickly.
